Game chosen: Concentration (Memory Game)

Ths game will require HTML, CSS and JS files to create.

Components: 
1) Main Image: This is the image the player will have to find
2) 6 Images: One of these images the player will have to match to 
the main image.

Directions:
These are 6 boxes that will show 
images. Then they will be flipped 
over to a common image. 1 of the 6 
images will match the main image. The 
player will have to pick the image that 
matches the main image. If the player picks
the incorrect image, they will have to try again.
After the player picks the correct image the will go 
on to ther next level. There is a small suprise waiting
for the player once they beat the levels a few times. But
they will have to figure it out...

MVP: player beating the initial level.
